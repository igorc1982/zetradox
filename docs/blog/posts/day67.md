# Our last two days in Munich

Yesterday we started our day off at yet another Christmas market at the Sendlinger Tor, one of a handful of markets in the Old Town area. We walked down busy shopping streets and then grabbed some lunch at the historic Augustiner Stammhaus, the oldest brewery in Munich and surrounding area.

The food was delicious, though Ajla did not prefer the spacialty sauce on her bun. We hit the fan shop once again so Vedran could buy the custom scarf for the Champions League game we were heading to in the evening. Needing to go back to the aparment around 5pm to get ready for the game, we left the very vibrant Marientplatz, where fans were already gathering for a quick brew and walk around the Christmas market before heading to the arena. While V and I headed out to the game, the girls went to the grocery store and grabbed some food on the way back, just in time to watch the game on TV. 
V and I met up with some Bayern Munich fans from the Detroit Fan Club for a quick beer before heading to our seats. The game was yet again an incredible experience, this one topping the atmosphere from Friday night's Bundesliga game vs. Augsburg. Happy with the 1-0 result and thankful that we had the opportunity to fullfil our dream of watching a Champions League game at the Allianz Arena, we headed back to the apartment via the subway. It took us over an hour to get back home, which is the reason why I did not post anything yesterday.

Today was our last day in Munich and we had a few more things on our list that we wanted to check off. We first headed to the English Garden and the Chinese Tower to yet another Christmas market. We spent about an hour shopping for some gifts, before taking a break at the Chinese Tower Bier Garden for a nice Hofbrau and some "Schmalznudel", which is essentialy a Bavarian-syle donut. We then headed back to the Marienplatz, where we walked around the market and grabbed some well-deserved coffee and hot chocolate. As the sun was going down, we headed over to St. Peter's Church and climbed over 300 steps (56 meters high) to get up to the tower viewing platform, which offers breathtaking 360-degree views of the entire city. Pamela and the kids walked casually around the tower platform, while I decided to stay just a few feet from the door. After all that climbing, we worked up an appetite and headed to one of the restaurants surrounding the Marientplatz for some dinner and drinks. Food was delicious here and kids thought it was the best since our arrival. After dinner, we walked around some more and finished the evening off with some yummy Nutella and strawberry crepes from one of the market stands. On our way back to the apartment, we stopped by the grocery store to get some last minute things for our almost 5 hour train ride tomorrow. We leave Munich very early to catch the ICE (Intercity Express) and head to Dusseldorf, where we'll stay until the end of our trip.
