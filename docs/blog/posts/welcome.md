# Welcome to Our Germany Adventure Blog!

Hello family and friends!

We’re so excited to welcome you to our travel blog, where we’ll be sharing all the adventures, mishaps, and magical moments from our upcoming trip to Germany between November 20 and December 4.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be exploring everything from the vibrant streets of Munich, Cologne, and Dusseldorf to the picturesque castles of Bavaria, and we can’t wait to bring you along for the ride (virtually, at least!). We’ll be posting regular updates, photos, and stories from the road, sharing everything from local food and drinks to all the exciting sights we've planned for.
