# Our arrival in Munich

Servus! (Traditional Bavarian Greeting)
We made it to Munich. We landed on time after a pretty comfortable flight. None of us really slept on the plane, which required resting time as soon as we checked into our apartment.

 After a couple of hours of naps and quiet time, we walked to the nearest Imbiss to finally taste some Doner Kebab (dish of Turkish origin). After a very tasty lunch, we walked to the nearest grocery store to fill up the fridge for our breakfasts and occasional snacks. Coffee was essential to keep us going, so we walked to a pretty cool coffee shop nearby. We finished off the evening at the nearest Paulaner beer hall, which as you can imagine, I really enjoyed. Pamela and kids played some Uno to stay awake. Tomorrow is a big day as we head to the Allianz Arena for our first of two games, this one being the Bundesliga clash against regional rivals Augsburg.
