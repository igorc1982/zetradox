(Traditional Bavarian Greeting) We made it to Munich. We landed on time after a pretty comfortable flight. None of us really slept on the plane, which required resting time as soon as we checked into our apartment. </p> <p>After a couple of hours of naps and quiet time, we walked to the nearest Imbiss to finally taste some Doner Kebab (dish of Turkish origin). After a very tasty lunch, we walked to the nearest grocery store to fill up the fridge for our breakfasts and occasional snacks. Coffee was essential to keep us going, so we walked to a pretty cool coffee shop nearby. We finished off the evening at the nearest Paulaner beer hall, which as you can imagine, I really enjoyed. Pamela and kids played some Uno to stay awake. Tomorrow is a big day as we head to the Allianz Arena for our first of two games, this one being the Bundesliga clash against regional rivals Augsburg. </p> Image Gallery"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/22/our-first-full-day/","title":"Our first full day","text":"<p>Still somewhat jet-lagged, we woke up around 9. V and I walked to the nearest bakery to get some Kaisersemmel (traditional rolls in Bavaria) for breakfast. Kids are absolutely loving the fresh baked goods here so we'll be repeating this daily until we leave I think. </p> <p>We then took off to the Marienplatz (Old Town) and just caught the world-famous Glockenspiel playing at noon with its 43 bells. Vedran couldn't wait to get to the FC Bayern Munich fan shop around the corner where we spent over an hour browsing countless products spread across 3 floors. We ended up buying just a few things at this fan shop knowing that we would buy our new gear at the Allianz Arena before the game. </p> <p>By the time we got out of the fan shop, we were ready for an afternoon beverage. We headed to a famous cafe at the Marienplatz for some coffee, hot chocolate, and a beer of course. We were squeezed for time since our Museum tour at the Allianz Arena ahead of the game started at 5pm and we still had to go back to the apartment to dress for freezing tempretures forecasted for that evening. On our way back to the apartment, we stopped at a small food court for a quick bite. Pamela had a fried cheese sandwhich while the kids shared a large schnitzel sandwhich. </p> <p>Once we put on some serious winter gear, we headed to the arena via U-Bahn (subway). We arrived just in time for the Museum tour and we had 90 minutes to get through the museum and the fan shop before the arena opened for the game. After a hefty bill at the fan shop, we headed to the arena pub for some beverages. The place was absolutely packed and the atmosphere was incredible, as one would expect before a Friday night game. We made it to our seats about an hour before kickoff as the snow was falling heavily and the temperature fell below zero. I'm not able to describe what V and I felt walking into the arena for the first time. As a matter of fact, I'll let Vedran tell you when we get back.</p> <p>An absolutely overwhelming day came to an end as we took the subway back into the city together with at least half of the 75,000 fans. We made it home around midnight and crashed quickly.</p> Image Gallery"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/23/our-first-of-many-christmas-markets/","title":"Our first of many Christmas markets","text":"<p>This morning we woke up late after sleeping in until about 10. It was a late night at the soccer game and none of us went to bed before midnight the night before. </p> <p>We had breakfast in the apartment and then headed once again to Altstadt (Old Town) to walk around and do some some sightseeing. We tried to get into the Hofbrauhaus but that was an impossible task on a Saturday. We ended up finding a small cafe for a quick pit stop before heading to the Munich Residenz, which is a huge palace built back in 1385. After about 2 hours of walking the 130 rooms (that's no joke), we visited the Weihnachtsdorf (Christmas Village) in the very courtyard of the palace. Gluhwein (hot, spiced wein) was the first priority here before tasting some Crepes filled with strawberries and Nutella. We finished off the evening with an awesome dinner at Der Pschorr, where most of us tasted the traditional Schnitzel dish. Tomorrow is a long day at the Neuschwanstein Castle with our tour bus leaving Munich around 9am. </p> Image Gallery"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/24/hiking-the-alps-to-neuschwanstein/","title":"Hiking the Alps to Neuschwanstein","text":"<p>Today was Neuschwanstein Castle tour day, which meant an early wake-up in order to meet up at the tour office and catch the train to Fussen. Our tour guide named Thomas has been to the castle a hundred times this year alone...do I need to say more about him? </p> <p>We took off for a two hour train ride around 10am and as you would expect from a German train system, we arrived in Fussen at exactly the scheduled time. For the entire two hour trip, Thomas was educating the group on the very short and peculiar life of King Ludwig II. Once we got off the train, we boarded a bus for a quick ride up to the Village of Hohenschwangau, which is where the castle is located. With 45 minutes to spare before our hike to the castle, we took a quick pitstop at a traditional Bavarian restaurant for some weiss wurst, pretzels, and a beer. At 12:45 we began our very steep hike up to the castle that took approximately 20-30 minutes, with Thomas taking a break every 10 minutes for all of us to catch our breath. Once we reached the castle, our next and impossible task was to capture the breathtaking views of the Neuschwanstein Castle. As beautiful as some pictures turned out, they don't even come close to capturing the size and elegance of this massive structure. Once we explored the exterior of the castle, we began our interior tour. Unfortunately you won't see any pictures of the interior, as smart phones and cameras during the interior tour are stricktly forbidden, with the exception of the castle kitchen. Before exiting the castle, we went out to the balcony and captured some awesome views of the Alps surrounding the castle and the village below. At around 3:45pm, we headed back down to the village to meet up with the group and head back to Munich. Hungry from a long day of walking, climbing, and hiking, we ate dinner at a very nice Vietnamese restaurant in our neighborhood. The food here was a pleasant change from the bratwursts and schnitzels we've been sampling since our arrival. </p> Image Gallery"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/25/another-busy-day-in-and-around-old-town/","title":"Another busy day in and around Old Town","text":"<p>This morning started off with a trip to the grocery store, followed by a quick breakfast. We then took off to the Bayern Munich training center on Sabener Strasse hoping to run into some players as they were driving in for another day of practice before the big game tomorrow. We must have however missed all of them by just a few minutes, as a small crowd of fans was slowly leaving the garage entrance of the training facility, as we were approaching. We quickly visited the fan shop there and took some pictures. </p> <p>Next on our list was the Viktualienmarkt which is a year-round outdoor market. We enjoyed the beautiful weather by taking a quick break at the \"Biergarten\" located on the market grounds. After a small incident caused by the local pigeons sitting on large tree branches above us, we made our way to the Hofbrauhaus for some more beer, wine, and pretzels. The place was not as busy as on Saturday, and we found a table fairly quickly. After about an hour, we continued our walk towards the Frauenkirche (Women's church) and the St. Michael's Church, where we saw the tomb of King Ludwig II. You'll remember him as the builder of the Neuschwanstein castle. As it was getting dark, we made our way to the Marientplatz Christmas Market for some snacks and Gluhwein (hot spiced wine). Hope you enjoy the pictures, though similar to yesterday, it's really hard to capture the beauty of the city hall at night during the holiday season. Before we walked over to the Medieval Christmas Market where vendors pay tribute to the old Munich city culture, we stopped by the fan shop once again so I could get a special scarf with custom embroidery of tomorrow's game. We finished our evening with some Crepes at the medieval market before taking the subway back to the apartment. If you're asking how Ajla is keeping up with all this walking, I don't have an answer. She's been an absolute champ on this trip, and I believe that all the dancing and tumbling classes have greatly prepared her for this trip. </p> Image Gallery"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/27/our-last-two-days-in-munich/","title":"Our last two days in Munich","text":"<p>Yesterday we started our day off at yet another Christmas market at the Sendlinger Tor, one of a handful of markets in the Old Town area. We walked down busy shopping streets and then grabbed some lunch at the historic Augustiner Stammhaus, the oldest brewery in Munich and surrounding area. </p> <p>The food was delicious, though Ajla did not prefer the spacialty sauce on her bun. We hit the fan shop once again so Vedran could buy the custom scarf for the Champions League game we were heading to in the evening. Needing to go back to the aparment around 5pm to get ready for the game, we left the very vibrant Marientplatz, where fans were already gathering for a quick brew and walk around the Christmas market before heading to the arena. While V and I headed out to the game, the girls went to the grocery store and grabbed some food on the way back, just in time to watch the game on TV.  V and I met up with some Bayern Munich fans from the Detroit Fan Club for a quick beer before heading to our seats. The game was yet again an incredible experience, this one topping the atmosphere from Friday night's Bundesliga game vs. Augsburg. Happy with the 1-0 result and thankful that we had the opportunity to fullfil our dream of watching a Champions League game at the Allianz Arena, we headed back to the apartment via the subway. It took us over an hour to get back home, which is the reason why I did not post anything yesterday.</p> <p>Today was our last day in Munich and we had a few more things on our list that we wanted to check off. We first headed to the English Garden and the Chinese Tower to yet another Christmas market. We spent about an hour shopping for some gifts, before taking a break at the Chinese Tower Bier Garden for a nice Hofbrau and some \"Schmalznudel\", which is essentialy a Bavarian-syle donut. We then headed back to the Marienplatz, where we walked around the market and grabbed some well-deserved coffee and hot chocolate. As the sun was going down, we headed over to St. Peter's Church and climbed over 300 steps (56 meters high) to get up to the tower viewing platform, which offers breathtaking 360-degree views of the entire city. Pamela and the kids walked casually around the tower platform, while I decided to stay just a few feet from the door. After all that climbing, we worked up an appetite and headed to one of the restaurants surrounding the Marientplatz for some dinner and drinks. Food was delicious here and kids thought it was the best since our arrival. After dinner, we walked around some more and finished the evening off with some yummy Nutella and strawberry crepes from one of the market stands. On our way back to the apartment, we stopped by the grocery store to get some last minute things for our almost 5 hour train ride tomorrow. We leave Munich very early to catch the ICE (Intercity Express) and head to Dusseldorf, where we'll stay until the end of our trip. </p> Image Gallery"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/20/made-it-to-ohare/","title":"Made it to O'Hare","text":"<p>After a long drive, we made it to Chicago and finally to O'Hare where we depart from at 6pm CST. </p> <p>Our drive to Chicago was smooth but we paid for it on our way to O'Hare which took over an hour from the very familiar 1101 S. State a.k.a Casa Miller. Robert met us downstairs and we spent just enough time with him to snap this photo (see gallery) before our Uber came to pick us up. After an hour drive, we made it to Terminal 1 and had a well deserved snack and bevarage at Burghoff's Cafe, which some of you will recognize as they have a restaurant on West Adams St. and it is a very famous German-style restaurant in the city.
